# COFF001.asm.p_utg.gfa.fasta: Pre-converted in the directory it is located in
# COFF001.asm.p_ctg.gfa.fasta: Pre-converted in the directory it is located in

# These FASTA files are then used to carry out compleasm and further quality metric analyses to determine which one should be used as the reference genome for downstream analyses
