# Thesis-Project: Comparative Genomic Analysis of Cochlearia Officinalis and Diploid Cochlearia Species

## This project involves a complex pipeline


### Inital HiFi Assembly Data
2 types of HiFi assembly data were provided from the same autotetraploid species to initally conduct genome completeness analysis and indentify which assembly should be used for downstream analysis and comparison against the diploid species - The 2 types of HiFi assembly data include:

#### 1: HiFi Assembly of the C.Officinalis without the --primary flag:
COFF001.asm.bp.hap1.p_ctg.gfa
COFF001.asm.bp.hap2.p_ctg.gfa 
COFF001.asm.bp.p_ctg.fa

#### 2: HiFi Assembly of the C.Officinalis with the --primary flag:
COFF001.asm.p_utg.gfa
COFF001.asm.p_ctg.gfa
COFF001.asm.a_ctg.gfa
