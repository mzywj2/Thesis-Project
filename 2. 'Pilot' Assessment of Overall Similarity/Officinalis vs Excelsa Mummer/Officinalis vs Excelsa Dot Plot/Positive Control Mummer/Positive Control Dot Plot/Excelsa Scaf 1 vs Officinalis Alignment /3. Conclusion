# The dot plot visalisation showed 4 scaffolds of Officinalis had "good" alignment with Excelsa scaffold 1, however, this did not seem representative enough of the officinalis genome
# Therefore, this process was considered a pilot run for overall alignment visualisation as we decided to go ahead with using the whole officinalis genome despite the lack of good alignment 
# This was indication that there is siginificant re-arrangement between the autotetraploid officinalis and the diploid Excelsa
