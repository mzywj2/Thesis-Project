# As mentioned in the chromsyn github page, to reduce errors and for compatibility with the chromsyn tool the busco files should follow this naming pattern:

genome_name.busco5.tsv
e.g. C_officinalis.busco5.tsv

The original .tsv file output from busco will likely be called full_table.tsv, this is the file that will be used
